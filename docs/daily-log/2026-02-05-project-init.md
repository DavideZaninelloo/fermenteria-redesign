# Daily Log - 2026-02-05

## Task: Project Initialization & Planning

### Activities
- Updated `GEMINI.md` to include mandatory daily logging.
- Created `docs/daily-log` directory.
- Initialized the Next.js project using `npx create-next-app`.

### Reasoning
- **Logging:** Essential for tracking progress and maintaining context across sessions.
- **Stack:** Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript as per project requirements for a modern, SEO-friendly, and performant site.
- **Structure:** Scaffolding the project in a `fermenteria` subdirectory to keep the root organized with project documents and the actual codebase.

### Future Plans
- Configure project styling (fonts, colors) based on the "Artigianale" mood.
- Implement the Hero section and Three Pillars.
- Set up the content structure for the menu (JSON/Markdown).
