## Task: Implementation of Core Homepage Sections

### Activities
- Configured Tailwind CSS v4 theme in `globals.css` with Brand colors (Green, Cream, Gold).
- Created and integrated global UI components: `Navbar`, `Footer`, `WhatsAppCTA`.
- Developed individual homepage sections: `Hero`, `Pillars`, `MenuPreview`, `Wines`, `GlutenFree`, `Testimonials`, `Location`, and `About`.
- Populated sections with authentic content from `MENU-2026.pdf` and scraped data.
- Verified project build with `npm run build`.

### Reasoning
- **Photo-Ready Strategy:** Implemented strict aspect ratios for all image placeholders to ensure a stable layout until professional assets are ready.
- **Conversion-First:** Placed multiple CTA points throughout the scroll to encourage WhatsApp and phone bookings.
- **Brand Alignment:** Focused messaging on "Artisanality" and "Inclusivity" as core value propositions.

### Future Plans
- Develop interactive `/menu` page.
- Implement SEO and Restaurant Schema.org metadata.
